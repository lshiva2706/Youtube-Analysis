# Youtube-Analysis

•Many youtubers are having issues with their content because they are not meeting the expectations of their users. There are numerous domains/categories on YouTube, and   while some youtubers release videos based on trends or different content to reach out to the public, which doesn’t work at all times. Youtubers face issue in not knowing the exact time to post the video to reach the large crowd. 

•Our primary goal is to assist youtubers by providing valuable insights in order to spread their content to mass on YouTube. 
These insights are provided by good exploratory data analysis for youtubers on the dashboard for their channel growth, including predicting the category using title-based description provided by the creator.

•This dataset contains data on daily trending YouTube videos from several months (and counting). Data is available for the US, GB, DE, CA, FR,  RU, MX, KR, JP and IN regions (United States, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and India respectively).
